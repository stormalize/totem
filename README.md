# Totem

![totem logo](/_preview/totem-logo-color-2.svg)

Reffect pack for Guild Wars 2. Requires https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect.

A modular template to construct your own custom pack to track important traits and effects for any build. Effects may fully reordered in order of priority for your particular build, as well as pinned to keep them in visible at all times and display a glow when you reach maximum stacks for that effect. This can be really helpful for getting a better sense of how much uptime you have or timing yours bursts.

## How to Use

1. This main `totem` pack needs to be installed first, as it contains all the custom graphics that are required to display properly, as well as a demo totem with some generic buffs. Please find a zip file available under [Releases](https://github.com/stormalize/totem/releases).
2. Next, go to the [Totem Forge](https://stormalize.github.io/totem-forge/) to craft your own custom totem pack.
